\section{Technical Experience}


My main experience with practical use of CS comes from an iternship I held at Sandia National Labs. During said internship, I was able to gain some experience managing databases with their solar department. During the internship, I also helped complete a project in which we made an interactive map of the solar arrays which would pull info from the database and relay it in real time. With this project I gained some experience with Mysql, PHP, and CSS.
