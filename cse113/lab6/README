bt full shows the values of used variables.
•

•
list
Command to show 10 lines of the source code, l is the shorthand for this command. Enter line number after command to make start point, place a "," before line number to make end point. Name function after command to display a certain function. Re-enter command to view next 10 lines.
•
help
Displays commands and uses of gdb, h is the shorthand for this. Entering a certain command after "help" displays information pertaining to that command.
•

•
continue
Runs the program until it reaches the next breakpoint or exits, c is the shorthand for this command.

•
disable/enable
