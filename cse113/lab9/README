Lab 9

USED 3 Late days for this lab
(Never managed to find the time to fix it, which is why its mostly incomplete)

Purpose: To emulate the binary calculator of a cup using a doubly linked list to store values

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
Even though I didn't finish this assignment, I gained a pretty good grasp on how to implement linked lists in asssignments.

Issues Found:
The biggest problem I faced really just had to do with simply understanding how to manage user input as well as how to define functions for the binary calculator operations.
Future Improvements:
Since I didn't finish this, I'll try and look back to complete it after I spend some time trying to get a better understanding of how to create the necessary functions for this program.
