Lab 3

Purpose: To summarize array details through the use of multiple functions

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I learned how to organize array, essentially. Through writing functions which provided details of an array I learned various methods of querying an array for specific information. For example, I learned that a bubble sort incrementally pairs numbers to check for a difference in size. I also learned how to organize my programs by using structures in C. 

Issues Found:
The biggest problem found was when writing the lab3_structure file. There wasn't really a specific bug ruining my progress so much as I just had trouble wrapping my head around what I was supposed to do. I can't put it very eloquently, but basically I had trouble figuring out how to transfer my function calls along with the structures.

Future Improvements:
I would like to change the program to allow the user to define the array while using the programs I wrote.


PSEUDO CODE


//counts the number of elements in an array that is less than to x
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] < x
                count = count + 1

//counts the number of elements in an array that is less than or equal to x
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] <= x
                count = count + 1

//counts the number of elements in an array that is greater than or equal to x
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] >= x
                count = count + 1

//counts the number of elements in an array that is greater than x
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if A[i] > x
                count = count + 1

//Reverses the list order of the array
//A[1..N], an array with N elements


while i = 1 < N
        tmp = a[i]
	a[i] = a[n]
	a[n] = tmp
	i + 1
	n - 1


//Finds the amount of numbers that are even
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if a[i] mod 2 == 0
		count  = count + 1

//Finds the amount of numbers that are even
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if a[i] mod 2 != 0
		count  = count + 1


//Finds the count of numbers divisible by a certain divisor
//A[1..N], an array with N elements

count = 0

for i = 1 to N
        if a[i] mod divisor == 0
		count  = count + 1
