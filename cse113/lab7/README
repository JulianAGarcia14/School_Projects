Purpose: To create certain functions using pointer notation.

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I essential learned pointer notation, how to create functions around pointers, and how pointers can be useful in programming.

Issues Found:
The biggest problems I faced had to do with errors resulting from me incorrectly using pointers in terms of getting incorrect results and in terms of having actual compiler errors.

Future Improvements:
I would like to clean up my code a bit more because I believe I could make what I wrote a bit better given more experience.
