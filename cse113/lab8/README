USED ALL LATE DAYS FOR THIS
(Honestly just never found the time to get to this assignment, even with the extra time, which is why its nowhere near complete)

Purpose: To create and manipulate linked lists

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I got the general idea of how to create and implement linked lists, but fail to fully grasp it.

Issues Found:
The biggest problems I faced had to do with simply understanding how to manage the nodes along with user input.
Future Improvements:
Seeing as I didn't finish this, I'll try and look back to complete it after I spend some time trying to understand it better.
