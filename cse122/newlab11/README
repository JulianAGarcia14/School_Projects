Purpose: To evaluate arrays and solve other problems using structures and enumerations.

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I learned how to use enumerations and structure arrays. Writing functions which required arrays with multiple values per index allowed me to get a grasp on how structures can be used as arrays. Solving problems which required multiple pre-defined values allowed me to understand how to use enumerations and allowed me to learn their usefulness.

Issues Found:
Again I can't say I ran into any specific issues other than just getting a grasp on the new structure concepts.

Future Improvements:
I would like to change the program to allow the user to define the arrays without having to look at the source code.
