USED 1 LATE DAY

Purpose: To time, compare, and evaluate various mathematical sums using for loops.

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I learned about time differentials between certain methods of using for loops. I also gained some experience in relating mathematical sums in programming language.

Issues Found:
The fibonacci sequence gave me a little bit of trouble in getting the output to match the one provided on the pdf. I fixed it by just messing with the indexing of the array.

Future Improvements:
Honestly there isn't much I can think of in the way of improvement for this lab.

Extra note: fib10.c is the code I used for part d of the 3rd question.
