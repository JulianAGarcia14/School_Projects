Used first late day.

Purpose: To evaluate coordinate systems using structures and by evaluating an input file and writing to an output

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I learned how to use strtok and strchr to parse a file (among other string functions), I also learned how to use two structures to dynamically allocate memory.

Issues Found:
For about a third of the time I was working on this I would run into either seg faults or the output would be completely NULL.

Future Improvements:
I would like to make my coordinate system more accurate in the kml document.
