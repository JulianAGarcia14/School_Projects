Purpose: To calculate various sums with for loops and actual sum formulas.

Conclusions:

Things I learned:
I learned how why it's more efficient to use written sums rather than use for loops to calculate sums. I also learned how to record the amount of time a function takes to run.

Issues Found:
Finding a way to make an early approximation for each number in newton's formula took me a while to come up with, I eventually realied that halving the original number until it was less that the square root of that number was the best way to do it.

Future Improvements:
I would like to see if I can make the code more efficient.
