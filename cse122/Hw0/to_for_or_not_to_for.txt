The largest k which you should be able to use in sum_no_for.c is 2,479,700,524.5, by plugging
in the largest sum possible which is 2^64-1 on a 64bit machine. This number would be different
in sum.c, the max sum would be would be (2^64-1) - 1 to account for the extra check added
by the for loop, I couldn't find this specific value because my calculator would do some automatic
rounding. The sum program without the for loop is the preferred program because it calculates
the sum in one operation, rather than the dozens or thousands of operations it would take with a for loop
