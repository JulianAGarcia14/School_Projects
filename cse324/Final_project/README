The only thing my interpreter really accomplishes is math operations.

To run this code compile as follows:
g++ -std=c++0x lisp.cpp -o lisp

I couldn't manage to get a makefile operational as the -std=c++0x flag wouldn't
cooperate however I chose to include it. Without that flag you may run into a 
"'stod' was not declared" error

Included are two predefined variables 'a' and 'b'
My progress ended with trying to define new variables
